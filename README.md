# Image-Segmentation
My task is to implement image segmentation using a conventional neural network on a ImageNet dataset.
My instructions were given as follows.

A project we will be working on is related to image segmentation. Image segmentation is a problem of determining what is where in the image. More formally, assigning every pixel in a photo a label, i.e. which object does it belong to. After a quick project related to 2D image segmentation, we will focus more to 3D images. This is important for the robot to understand where are the objects in a scene.

To begin with, create a GitHub repository where you will have your code and implement image segmentation using a convolutional neural network of your choice on ImageNet dataset. Please have everything about your project described in README.md of your repository (something like this: https://github.com/u0953009/Binary-Classifier). In terms of the programming languages/frameworks , please stick to Python 3 / tensorflow / keras.
Here are some resources that could help you:
Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=image+segmentation
Tensorflow tutorial: https://missinglink.ai/guides/tensorflow/tensorflow-image-segmentation-two-quick-tutorials/
Segmentation tutorial: https://medium.com/nanonets/how-to-do-image-segmentation-using-deep-learning-c673cc5862ef
ImageNet dataset: http://www.image-net.org/
Once you have this implemented, we can meet and discuss the step of moving to 3D.


As I have no experiance with neural networks or with image segmentation, I started by downloading the pretrained VGG16 model to do some experimentation on how the whole idea works. I started with a dataset given by a tensorflow tutorial.
